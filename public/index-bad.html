‘Indigene’ (Latin = ‘self-generating’)    +     'Community' (Latin 'com' = 'together' + 'munus' = 'gift or service')
'Indigène' (Latine = 'généré du soi') + 'Communauté' (Latine 'com' = 'ensemble' + 'munus' = 'cadeau ou service')
Indigene Community www.indigenecommunity.info   Communauté Indigène
LaSalle Gardens, Kahnawake North, ‘Do-we-know-who-we-are-?’  is centered in the rues Clement, Bergevin, Jean-Milot, des-Oblats, Louis-Fortier, Vezina, St-Patrick, Stirling neighbourhood.  Residents & businesses from other neighbourhoods are welcome & will eventually form new nuclei.
Human Resource Catalogue, HRC, Resource Mapping & online accounting within a Community Investment & Exchange System CIES based in humanity’s worldwide ‘self-generating’ heritage.

Welcome to our on-line CATALOGUING of folks & their talents, goods & services, which supply our neighbourhood ‘community’ (L ‘together + gift or services’). Each person is invited to join our committee & place text-descriptions, pictures, video & audio, documents & links to your web sites. Do you have new or second-hand goods, talents or services, which you’d like to market among your neighbours & further, on-line? Would you like to meet & join with other vendors in your community, who have similar talents & goods to form ‘companies’ (L. ‘together’ + ‘bread’) with greater capacities?

Each EXCHANGE brings Vendors ‘Memes’ which bring ownership, voting power & credits for the gifts & services of others.  We have individual & business members.  Meme-holders are grouped together with other similar vendors in Production Societies, which compose the ‘corporation’ (L ‘corp’ = ‘body’) & are represented on the board.  We charge approximately 7% per transaction as an Administration fee to the Vendor.  We require that Vendors invest approximately 8% (Depending on meme ownership, volume sales & our specialized Production Societies are charged less) per transaction in Memes.

MULTI-STAKEHOLDER MEMBERS – Our ‘indigenous’ (L ‘self-generating’) ‘economic’ (Greek ‘oikos’ = ‘home’) system is designed to include the whole community with every form of contribution people make to their essential goods & services economy accounted for through Time-based Human-Resource Accounting & ‘caucused’ (Iroquois = ‘grouping of like interests’).  The following four stakeholder accounting modules for Consumers, Workers, Suppliers & Founders, represent the full-cycle of the economic cycle.  This holistic indigenous accounting heritage is the long forgotten origin of both capitalism & cooperation, which fragment from it during the invasions, aggressions & murder of the colonial period up to & including our time.

CONSUMER members own at least 2 Memes per family or household.  With increased levels of memes Consumers are charged less per transaction. Every Meme invested accredits 1/10th % of each transactions value to the Customer’s Meme account. Every 10 Memes invested in ownership accredits 1 % of each Vendor/Customer sale per Transaction credited to a Customer’s Meme account up to a maximum of 10% taken proportionately from the 7% Administration & 8% Meme investment. All Meme holders receive the Bank of Canada interest rate plus.

REGISTERED AFFILIATE Consumers are those non-members who own less than 2 Memes & pay a Registration Fee (? Meme / year) to be accredited ? % per transaction in building their Meme Account.

WORKER members own at least 20 Memes, investing expertise, time, knowledge, skills etc at less than 50% of their Compensation Package in Memes.  

SUPPLIER members own at least 20 Memes, investing Goods & Services such as through exceptional discounts recognized as investments into the Corporate Economy.

FOUNDER / FUND members own at least 40 Memes, investing expertise, resources, time, knowledge, etc. at a rate of greater than 50% of compensation in Memes.

YEARLY REGISTRATION FEE: Members are charged only one Registration/Record Fee per year equal to ? Meme (5$08).  This fee includes membership in all Associations covered by this fee.

MEMES (Memory of contributions) are equal in value to the current Quebec Minimum Wage (10$15/  
 hour in 2013) or the value of a basic hour of work for an untrained beginning worker, which is capable of supporting a Living-Wage.  As Quebec’s Minimum Wage rises so does the value of the Meme.  The Corporate Board may adjust the Meme’s value in consideration of an adequate Living Wage. Each Vendor is free to charge rates per hour or per task as they desire but we expect rates roughly following market rates for goods & services.  Members invest/affiliate their Memes to accounts within each Association where their membership rights & benefits are received.

Vendor Members are required to own a MINIMUM of one Meme (non-voting). Each stakeholder Association has a schedule of minimum & maximum Meme ownership & the rights associated with each level of Progressive Ownership. At minimums of:  2 memes, Consumers are voting members, 20 Memes, Workers are voting, 20 Memes, Suppliers are voting & 40 Memes, Founders are voting members.  Each Meme provides a vote for voting members to express their will within each Association & through their elected Directors on the Corporate Board of Directors.

MAXIMUM Meme ownership per person is determined to keep Popular Participatory ownership decision-making within each Association described within the Document ‘Sharing our Livelihood’. When members of Consumer, Worker & Supplier Associations have passed their Association maximum share ownership levels, they are able to transfer these into the Founder/Fund Association. https://sites.google.com/site/indigenecommunity/relational-economy/3-sharing-livelihood-constitution 

RATEABLE CORPORATIONS – The human responsibility to recognize, welcome & include each other in economy & community is an old practice at the root of community.  Indigene Community calls for all corporations, institutions  & government to become Participatory as found in provisions for Rateable Corporations in both profit & non-profit corporate law.  https://sites.google.com/site/indigenecommunity/relational-economy/3-rateable-corporations
